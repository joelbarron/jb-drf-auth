Current production-completion status:

1. Release readiness
- Completed: CI now validates API docs/Postman consistency via `scripts/check_api_docs.py`.
- Completed: release docs include explicit pre-release docs-sync validation steps.

Remaining:
- Keep semantic changelog curation disciplined on every release (`fix`, `feat`, `breaking` notes).
